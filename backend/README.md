# App Backend

This is a collection of code that is meant to live in the backend.

- `pocketbase_direct` just contains a pocketbase installation.
  It's best used when we can use Let's Encrypt for Certificate signing.

  TODO: Consider replacing this with a link to the Pocketbase project

- `pocketbase_docker_windows` contains a dockerized version of pocketbase, with reverse proxy. 
  This is best used for when we cannot use Let's Encrypt. 

- `pocketbase_scripts` contains a node project with scripts for loading incoming Excel data, and generating outgoing Excel reports.

## Installation

//TODO: Add full installation here once I get all the details, 
preferably with an all in one script to install/start up

## Usage

//TODO: Add a guide here explaining the different components, and where to put in request excel files,
and where to collect files
